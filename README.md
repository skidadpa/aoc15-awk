AWK solutions for Advent of Code 2015
=====================================
After deciding to implement the 2021 Advent of Code challenges in AWK, I
decided to go back to some of the previous year challenges as well. This
daily programming challenge can be found at http://www.adventofcode.com.

Here are my solutions. There is a folder for each day, each containing:

| file         | description                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Makefile     | Makefile that runs a regression by default  |
| expected.txt | Expected results of regression test         |
| sample.txt   | sample input from the challenge description |
| input.txt    | test input from the challenge description   |
| one.awk      | first solution                              |
| two.awk      | second solution                             |
| *            | additional files as needed                  |

I had gotten through the first have of day 19, although the second half
proved a bit tricky, especially in AWK. The solution can be deduced via
some study into the nature of the data itself. That still seems like a
bit of a cheat, although perhaps I may use that mechanism in order to
move forward. Meanwhile, I'll give it another try. We're into the 2022
challenges now, so I'm taking a look again.

I had previously logged in using a different mechanism (probably email),
although for 2022 I used my GitHub credentials, and the inputs/solutions
are different. So I'm updating the repo to match the new problem set. I
also discovered that Day 17 was broken (not sure what happened), so I've
fixed that.
